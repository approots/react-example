This is a React component created for a large React/PHP/AWS project https://want2work.com.

It's a custom select menu that will hide when the user clicks off of it. It's incomplete without the Redux store or CSS but hopefully serves as an example of my React work. It demonstrates my coding style and how React can be used alongside the imperative DOM when necessary.
